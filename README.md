# LinOS
Hey, today i decided to start creating a OS who can use Linux in OpenComputers, this might be difficult but like John Cena said: Never Give Up.
But to warn you, the OS will be based on MineOS, in librairies and maybe GUI. Let's take it like a update to it. If you want to help me on this project.
